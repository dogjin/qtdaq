# qtdaq
QtDAQ is a rather large portion (30 000 lines of code) of my PhD. It is a digital data
acquisition system (DAQ) for high speed digitizers, performing analysis of captured waveforms. In order
to maximize flexibility, it has a multiple document interface (MDI), where users can add a number of
plots of different types to a specific template, which can be recalled at a later stage. In addition to built-
in analysis routines, the Google V8 JavaScript engine has been embedded, allowing the user to run
custom code that interacts with the analyzed data. QtDAQ has been used to analyze data for a number
of peer reviewed journal articles.
